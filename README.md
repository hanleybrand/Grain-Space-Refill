This is a library of patches for [Propellerheads Reason 10](https://www.propellerheads.se/en/reason) , specifically the  [Grain Sample Manipulator](https://www.propellerheads.se/en/reason/instruments/grain). 

When Reason 10 was released I was mostly interested in experimenting with Grain but being a lifelong hobbyist and musical noodler, I found that with no driving idea/project/concept it was hard to make or evaluate decisions (e.g. "is this weird sound any good for anything?"). So as usual, I was noodling.

Luckily, [NASA](https://soundcloud.com/nasa/tracks) put out a playlist [Spooky Sounds from Across the Solar System ](https://soundcloud.com/nasa/sets/spookyspacesounds) at pretty much the same time, and that got me going. 

So that's what this Refil is about. _SPAAAaace_. 


The Reason patches in this repo are created by me, and are distributed via the Unlicense, mainly because attribution with audio is so tedious, but if you love it or get super famous/rich and you can attribute it partially to using these patches, a shout out or backstage pass when you tour the U.S. East Coast would be lovely, but I'll take being on the list.  

It likely goes without saying, but the Unlicense only applies to the creative work stored in the patch files, but does not apply to Propellerheads file formats or software. Some of the patches may be based on an altered default patch that was distributed with Reason 10, hopefully that's ok.
