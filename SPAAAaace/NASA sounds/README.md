Filename | Title/Link | Notes 
------------ |------------ |------------ 
Cassini-Saturn Radio Emissions num2.aiff | [Cassini: Saturn Radio Emissions #2](https://soundcloud.com/nasa/cassini-saturn-radio-emissions-2) | "Saturn is a source of intense radio emissions, which were monitored by our Cassini spacecraft. The radio waves are closely related to the auroras near the poles of the planet. These auroras are similar to Earth's northern and southern lights. This is an audio file of radio emissions from Saturn."
Cassini Shields Up.aiff | [Cassini Shields Up](https://soundcloud.com/nasa/cassini-shields-up) | "Before settling into orbit around Saturn, Cassini faced a white-knuckle ride through the plane of the planet’s rings. When converted into an audio file, the interstellar cacophony is reminiscent of a hellstorm on Earth."
ganymede.aiff | [Beware of Jupiter’s Largest Moon Ganymede](https://soundcloud.com/nasa/beware-of-jupiters-largest-moon-ganymede) | "And beware the weird radio emissions Galileo gathered from Jupiter's largest moon, Ganymede."
Radar Echoes From Titan's Surface.aiff | [Radar Echoes From Titan's Surface](https://soundcloud.com/nasa/radar-echoes-from-titans-surface) | "This recording was produced by converting into audible sounds some of the radar echoes received by Huygens during the last few kilometers of its descent onto Saturn's moon Titan. As the probe approaches the ground, both the pitch and intensity increase. Scientists will use intensity of the echoes to speculate about the nature of the surface.

Ultra Cold Liquid Helium-3.aiff | [Ultra Cold Liquid Helium-3](https://soundcloud.com/nasa/ultra-cold-liquid-helium-3) | "... the strange whistle of ultra-cold liquid helium-3 that changes volume relative to the North Pole and Earth's rotation. When ultra-cold liquid helium-4 was squashed through an array of tiny apertures, a phenomenon occurred in which the helium-4 repeatedly sped up, slowed down and vibrated. This produced a "quantum whistle" -- a whistling sound that went from high to low."
Juno Morse code _HI_ received from Earth.aiff | [Juno: Morse code "HI" received from Earth](https://soundcloud.com/nasa/juno-morse-code-hi-received-from-earth) | "During its close flyby of Earth in 2013, NASA's Jupiter-bound Juno spacecraft listened for -- and heard -- a coordinated, global transmission from amateur radio operators using its radio and plasma wave science instrument. The message said "HI" in Morse code. More details about this sound can be found here: [photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17744](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17744)"
578625main_sputnik-beep.aiff | [Sputnik: Beep](https://soundcloud.com/nasa/sputnik-beep) | The Soviet Union launched a beeping ball into space, so we retaliated with a moon trip and making all the children take more science classes. 
whistler waves.aiff | [Whistler Waves](https://soundcloud.com/nasa/whistler-waves2) | "Whistler waves as heard by the EMFISIS instrument aboard NASA’s Van Allen Probes as it passed around Earth. Credits: NASA/University of Iowa"
sun_sonification.wav | [Sun Sonification](https://soundcloud.com/nasa/sun-sonification) | "The Stanford Experimental Physics Lab sonified data from the European Space Agency and NASA's Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). This humming sound captures the Sun’s natural vibrations and provides scientists with a concrete representation of its dynamic movements For more solar sounds, visit: [oi.stanford.edu](oi.stanford.edu/results/sounds.html)"
